Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code is essential for long-term effectiveness and efficiency of software systems. To achieve this, one should use clear variable names, write comments, break code into functions or modules, use consistent formatting, and test code. The advantages of working in this way include reduced maintenance costs, increased productivity, improved collaboration, and better software quality. In addition to having a better reputation for the company, since the requirements are being met. 
There are various approaches a computer scientist takes to solve a problem, but a general outline would involve approaching a problem means understanding and breaking down the problem, designing and implementing a solution using algorithms and data structures, evaluating and improving the solution, and collaborating with others. Critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and documentation are essential throughout the process. The process needed to solve a problem would change depending on the issue at hand. For example, having limited time, limited use of technology or software, as well as having a smaller budget. Those may change the approach needed to come up with a solution. A more technical problem would be having a limited database.
Computer scientists study and solve problems related to computation and information processing by developing and designing algorithms, software, hardware, and systems. Their work has led to the development of new technologies that have transformed society and enabled new forms of innovation and creativity. Computer science is critical to many aspects of modern life, and it offers many exciting career opportunities in fields such as software development, data science, cybersecurity, and computer engineering.
